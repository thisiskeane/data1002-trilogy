# USyd DATA1002 Projects Trilogy
A second trilogy of projects made during the first year of my Data Science major.

## Stage 1

The aim of this first stage of the project was to observe multiple stock exchanges from different countries and examine their respective performances over 3 years (from 2019 to 2021 inclusive). The four stock exchanges chosen were Nasdaq (USA), FTSE200 (UK), ASX200 (Aus) and Bovespa (Brazil).

Data was resourced and collected from various sources such as *The Wall Street Journal*, *Yahoo! Finance*, *Australian Securities Exchange* and *Investing.com*. Data was then cleaned and analysed through Python with factors such as:
- Average percentage change
- Average opening and closing price each year
- Average growth per year

Respective flaws and limitations for each dataset were also listed. Relevant code for Stage 1 is included in project report.



## Stage 2

The aim of this second stage of the project was to investigate lifestyle choices which have the greatest impact on a person's BMI. The four lifestyle choices chosen are:
- Exercise
- Smoking
- Alcohol consumption
- Dietary habits

Data was collected and resourced from the 2017 - 2018 National Health Survey from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Data was cleaned and again analysed through Python with results aggregated and represented visually. 

Respective flaws and limitations for each dataset were also listed. Relevant code for Stage 2 is included in project report.



## Stage 3

The aim for the third and final stage of the project was to analyse iris plants and their respective attributes through various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and decision tree. Factors analysed for each plant include:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
- Flower class

Each algorithm was tested with the dataset and accuracies and flaws were noted, along with the overall performance of the model itself.

Relevant code for Stage 3 is included in the project report.
